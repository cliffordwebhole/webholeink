# Image Conventions

WebholeInk supports images and media using the simplest, most durable approach
possible: **static files served directly by the web server**.

There is no media library, no uploads interface, and no database-backed metadata.
Images are treated as first-class web assets — not application objects.

This document defines the conventions for using images consistently and
predictably across posts, pages, and documentation.

---

## Core Principles

- Images are **files**, not records
- URLs are **stable and explicit**
- Media is **owned by the operator**
- Nothing is transformed at runtime
- The web server serves assets directly

If an image can be copied with `cp -r`, it belongs in WebholeInk.

---

## Directory Structure

All images MUST live under the `public/` directory so they can be served
directly by the web server.

Recommended structure:

public/ media/ posts/ core-stable/ diagram.png flow.svg 
docs/ architecture/ system-flow.png pages/ 
about/ hero.jpg

You may organize subdirectories however you like, but **do not store images outside `public/`**.

## Referencing Images in Markdown
### Standard Markdown Syntax 
```bash 
![Alt text](/media/docs/architecture/system-flow.png) 
```
• Paths must be absolute (start with /)
• Alt text is required for accessibility


## Inline HTML (Allowed)

For more control, inline HTML is permitted:
`<img src=" " >` 

This is useful for:
• Custom attributes
• CSS classes
• Explicit sizing

## Image Formats
Supported formats depend entirely on the browser and web server.
Recommended formats:
• PNG – diagrams, UI captures
• SVG – architecture diagrams, icons
• JPG/JPEG – photos
• WEBP – optional, if you choose
WebholeInk does not process or convert images.

## Styling Images
Image styling is handled entirely via CSS.
Example:
.post-content img { max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; } 
No inline styles are required or generated by the engine.

## Captions (Optional)
Use semantic HTML when captions are needed:
```
<figure> <img src="/media/docs/router/flow.png" alt="Router flow">
<figcaption>Request routing flow in WebholeInk</figcaption></figure> 
```
Markdown parsers pass this through unchanged.
## Front Matter and Images

WebholeInk does not require image metadata.
However, optional front matter MAY be used for informational purposes:
image: /media/posts/core-stable/cover.png 
This value is not interpreted by the engine unless you explicitly choose to use it in templates.
## Caching and Performance

Because images are static files:
• They are cacheable by browsers
• They can be cached by CDNs
• They are served without PHP involvement
Operators are encouraged to set long cache lifetimes at the web server level.

 ## What WebholeInk Does Not Do 
 
By design, WebholeInk does not include:
• Media uploads
• Image resizing or cropping
• Thumbnail generation
• Media metadata storage
• Image optimization pipelines
These concerns are intentionally left outside the engine.
## Summary
Images in WebholeInk are:
• Simple
• Predictable
• Portable
• Durable
If you can copy the directory and the links still work, the system is behaving correctly.
This is boring publishing — and that is the point.
