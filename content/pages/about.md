**WebholeInk** is a minimal, security-first blogging engine for developers
who value stability, ownership, and boring technology over features and hype.

This is not a platform.
This is infrastructure for publishing.

## Why WebholeInk?

Most blogging systems fail over time by trying to serve everyone.

WebholeInk serves a specific audience:
people who care about predictability, auditability, and long-term ownership
more than convenience or growth.
